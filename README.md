# stack.gl: WebGL through small modules

# WebGL overview

* Extension of canvas API
* (Nearly) 1:1 translation of OpenGL ES 2.0
* Supported nearly everywhere:
    + Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE 11+, iOS 8+, Android
* Firefox requires users install up-to-date video drivers
* Managed by Khronos group, extremely thorough tests
    + High degree of conformance across implementations

# Why it is important

* Advanced graphical capabilities
* Get native performance with no installation

# How WebGL works

* Shaders: Programs run on GPU
* Buffers: Store data on GPU
* Drawing commands: Render stuff

# Learning WebGL

# nodeschool

* shader-school and webgl-workshop

# WebGL Frameworks

* THREE.js - Popular scene graph based library
* Babylon - 
* Cesium - Optimized for GIS applications
* ... and many more

# stack.gl

Build small, single purpose abstractions starting from the bottom up.

* npm/browserify - distributed, modular dependencies
* strictly follows semantic versioning

# glslify

Lets you use modules in shaders

Example


# WebGL abstractions

# Linear algebra/arithmetic

# Geometry processing
